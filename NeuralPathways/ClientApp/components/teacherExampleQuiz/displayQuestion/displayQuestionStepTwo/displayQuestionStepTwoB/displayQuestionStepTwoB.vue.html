            No, we would not want to subtract {{ C }} from both sides. This would actually only change the values in the equation, and would not further isolate X like we want:

                    Instead we want to add {{ C }} to both sides. This will accomplish the goal of having X alone on one side of the equation:

            <tr>
                <th>

                    Rational: We are trying to isolate the variable X. This means we want X to be all by itself on one side of the equation. By adding {{ C }} to both sides, we have removed the - {{ C }} from the right hand side and left X all alone.
