            No, we would not want to subtract X from both sides, this only moves the X from one side of the equation to the other, but does not get us any closer to isolating the X.

                    Rational: Once you have isolated the variable X to one side of the “=” sign, the equation is solved. Typically you will want to perform all possible mathematical operations and reduce. You can verify that {{ L }} = X has met both criteria.
