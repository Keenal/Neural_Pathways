            No, we would not want to add C to both sides, this would actually move us a step in the wrong direction:

                    Instead we want to divide both sides by B. This will move us closer to having X alone on one side of the equation:

                    Rational: We are trying to isolate the variable X . This means we want X to be all by itself on one side of the equation. Each step should help peel a layer surrounding the X, and move it (all other numbers and variables) to the opposite side of the “=” sign.
