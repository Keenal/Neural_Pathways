            Yes, that is correct! We DO want to divide both sides by {{ B }}. This will move us closer to having X alone on one side of the equation:
        </p>
        <p class="displayQuestionStepOneDUIP">
            {{ A }} / {{ B }} = ({{ B }} (X - {{ C }})) / {{ B }} 	→	{{ F }} = (X - {{ C }})
        </p>

                    Rational: We are trying to isolate the variable X. This means we want X to be all by itself on one side of the equation. Each step should help peel a layer surrounding the X, and move it (all other numbers and variables) to the opposite side of the “=” sign.
