            Yes, that is correct! We DO want to divide both sides by B. This will move us closer to having x alone on one side of the equation:

        <p class="displayQuestionStepOneDUIP">
            A / B = (B (X - C)) / B 	→	F = (X - C)
        </p>

                    Rational: We are trying to isolate the variable X. This means we want X to be all by itself on one side of the equation. Each step should help peel a layer surrounding the X, and move it (all other numbers and variables) to the opposite side of the “=” sign.
