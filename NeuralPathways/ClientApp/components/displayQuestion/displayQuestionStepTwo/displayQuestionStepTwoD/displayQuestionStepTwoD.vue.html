            No, we would not want to divide both sides by F, this would actually move us a step in the wrong direction:

                    Instead we want to add C to both sides. This will accomplish the goal of having  X alone on one side of the equation:

                    Rational: We are trying to isolate the variable X. This means we want X to be all by itself on one side of the equation. By dividing both sides by F we are actually adding another step we must accomplish before isolating the X.
