            No, we would not want to subtract X from both sides, this only moves the X from one side of the equation to the other, but does not get us any closer to isolating the X:

                    Instead we want to add C to both sides. This will accomplish the goal of having  X alone on one side of the equation:

                    Rational: We are trying to isolate the variable X. This means we want X to be all by itself on one side of the equation. By adding 5 to both sides, we have removed the - C from the right hand side and left X all alone.
