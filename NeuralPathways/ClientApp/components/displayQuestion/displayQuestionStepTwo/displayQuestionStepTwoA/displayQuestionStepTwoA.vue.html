            Yes, that is correct! We DO want to add C to both sides. This will accomplish the goal of having  X alone on one side of the equation:
        </p>
        <p class="displayQuestionStepTwoAUIP">
            F + C = X - C + C 	→	L = X
        </p>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <th>

                <td>
                    Rational: We are trying to isolate the variable X. This means we want X to be all by itself on one side of the equation. By adding 5 to both sides, we have removed the - C from the right hand side and left X all alone.
