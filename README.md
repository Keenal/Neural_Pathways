# Neural_Pathways


Neural Pathways is a web application that allows students a set of quizzes for the purpose of tracking learning. A quiz will follow a certain format, allowing steps and mistakes to be tracked. The results of the scores will be saved and will allow the teachers to view the results and identify when a group of students do not get the questions correct. This will also provide data about what step of each problem the students are struggling with. This is even more important if we can follow a classroom trend because teachers can somehow adjust teaching techniques, or determine best practices. The goal of this application is to turn learning on its head.
